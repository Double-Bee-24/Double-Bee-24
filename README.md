# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 My Programming Journey

My adventure in the programming world began with a **computer science course**, where I started by writing instructions for Karel the robot 🤖. This foundation introduced me to essential concepts like functions, variables, data types, and object-oriented programming basics.

### 🔍 **Algorithm Development**
I've implemented various algorithms ranging from mathematical formula implementations to graph traversal algorithms like **Depth-First Search** and **Breadth-First Search**.

### 🎨 **Frontend Focus**
I transitioned into **Frontend development with React** because I wanted to see immediate results of my work. The instant visual feedback was incredibly motivating and helped accelerate my learning.

### 🔧 **Full-Stack Exploration**
While studying Frontend, I became curious about the backend side of things, so I completed both frontend and backend courses to get a complete picture of web development.

### 🐧 **Linux & Development Environment**
- **OS**: Ubuntu (my go-to Linux distribution)
- **Desktop Environment**: GNOME (tried KDE but found it overwhelming)
- **Editor**: Neovim with LazyVim template + custom tweaks (mostly Prettier configuration)
- **Rust-based CLI Tools**: I've embraced several Rust-powered tools that enhance my workflow:
  - `bottom` - system monitor
  - `ripgrep` - lightning-fast search
  - `eza` - modern ls replacement with colors and icons
  - And other modern CLI alternatives

I enjoy slowly but surely discovering new Neovim features and optimizing my development workflow.

### 📝 **Language Preference**
I prefer **TypeScript** over JavaScript for its static typing capabilities. Dynamic JavaScript just isn't my cup of tea, so TypeScript has been my faithful companion throughout most of my development journey.
